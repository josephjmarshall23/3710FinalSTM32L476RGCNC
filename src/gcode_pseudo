init_UART copied from lab 8
  additionally need to print GRBL version to start comms
  printPgmString(PSTR("\r\nGrbl " GRBL_VERSION " ['$' for help]\r\n"));


get_Gcommand() {

  char command[40][15]; //array of 40 strings of 15 chars

  while(!NULL) {
    get string from UART character by character using interrupts (lab 8)
    use space char as a deliminator to save each chunk of the command in an array as separate elements
    increment count of elements
  }


}
execute_Gcommand() {

  switch(command[1]){
  case: G0 //rapid move (travel, should move as fast as possible to position, no drawing)
  case: G1 //drawing line (move at specificed speed)
  case: G2 //arc clock wise
  case: G3 //arc counter clock wise (ask joe how to do it might just need to call draw arc and invert an argument)
  case: G28 //home 
  //... see what else is in inkscape gcode
  default: 
    return Error code over UART
