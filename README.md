# 3710FinalSTM32L476RGCNC
A final project for USU's ECE 3710 class, using an STM32L476RGTx as a CNC pen plotter controller.


Uses hardware derived from https://github.com/IVProjects/Engineering_Projects/tree/main/ProjectFiles/High-Speed%20Pen%20Plotter.

Uses a GRBL CNC shield for an Arduino, which plugs onto the headers on the Nucleo board.
